# Overview

This budget database was created to help me learn more about SQL programming. I picked SQLite because it is a C-language package that offers a small, efficient, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured SQL database engine. I made a basic budget software as a practice that allows the user to add, delete, and update their budget table. The user will have the choice of seeing both their budget table and their overall budgeted amount.

# Future Work

* I'd like to make it better by integrating an actual spending table so that the user can keep track of their spending. Then, at the end of the month, have a function to decide whether or not they stayed inside budget.
* Instead of communicating with the terminal, the user interacts with a front end web page.
